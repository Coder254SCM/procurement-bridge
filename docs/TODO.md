## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
1. **Database Schema**: ✅ COMPLETED - All tables created
2. **API Layer**: ❌ CRITICAL - Must implement immediately
3. **Frontend Components**: ❌ HIGH PRIORITY - Depends on API
4. **Testing**: ❌ Required for each component
5. **Documentation**: ✅ IN PROGRESS

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Next 7 Days)
1. Implement E-Catalog Management API
2. Implement Purchase Requisition API
3. Create basic frontend components
4. Add comprehensive testing
5. Update progress tracking
